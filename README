OpenOffice.org - split build
============================

This package provides the possibility to build OpenOffice.org by pieces.  This
one is the URE (UNO Runtime Environment) stuff that you need to be able to
build the rest of the OOo.

To build, do the usual

./autogen.sh or ./configure
make
make install
