07/07/2004 (SB): BugID=i29741
  Reference registries for the OOo 2.0 branch copied from the OOo 1.1 branch:
    OO_20/types.rdb <- OO_11/types.rdb 1.6
    OO_20/types_doc.rdb <- OO_11/types_doc.rdb 1.8
  Changed accumulation-based services to single-interface--based ones
  (types_doc.rdb only):
    com.sun.star.bridge.UnoUrlResolver
    com.sun.star.connection.Acceptor
    com.sun.star.connection.Connector

07/08/2004 (SB): BugID=i29741
  Changed accumulation-based services to single-interface--based ones
  (types_doc.rdb only):
    com.sun.star.sdb.InteractionHandler
    com.sun.star.sdbc.ConnectionPool

07/12/2004 (SB): BugID=i29741
  Resync'ed OO_20/types_doc.rdb <- OO_11/types_doc.rdb 1.10 (plus all
  modifications listed above)

08/18/2004 (JSC/JL): BugID=i31702
  remove needs entry in com.sun.star.system.SimpleCommandMail because needs is 
  deprecated and it caused an assertion in the cli_ure project while generating
  the cli interfaces from type library.

11/19/2004 (JSC/TL): BugID=i36687
  adjust ChainedTextFrame service. Remove XChainable interface and insert propeties.
  Interface was never implmented and the functionality was supported by properties.

01/20/2005 (JSC): BugID=i40985
  change const value com.sun.star.configuration.backend.NodeAttribute:MASK to 
  0x7F00 insterad of 0xFF00. Necessary because of a bug fix in idlc and possible
  because only 3 bits are masked.

02/18/05 (JSC/TL): BugID=i42890
  change ForBiddenCharacters property of com.sun.star.document.Settings
  -> remove the readonly flag, it should never have been readonly.

05/10/05 (JSC/TL): BugID=i43697
  we removed the duplicated reference to XEnumerationAccess.

08/26/05 (JSC): TaskID=i53814
  I've exchanged the current type library to the type library of OO2.0 (build m125) 
  for all further compatibility type checks.

10/21/05 (JSC): TaskID=i56329
  Correct com.sun.star.sdb.OfficeDatabaseDocument, it supports one more interface
  and it is not published -> compatible change.
  Correct com.sun.star.text.XEnumerationAccess, remove duplicate interface from 
  published service. Also a compatible change.
  Probably the regcompare tools needs to be improved

10/26/05 (JSC): TaskID=i25406, i25472, i50417
  ..style.CharacterPropertiesAsian -> remove 3 wrong paragraph properties
  ..style.PageProperties -> for 93 properties related to footer and header 
  the attribute maybevoid was inserted
  ..text.textfield.DateTime -> NumberFormat changed from short to long
  to ensure that the same format is used in all applications

01/25/06 (JSC): TaskID=i611389
  change the compatibility test to use always the type library in the type_reference
  directory. We need only one reference per source stand. I have also removed the 
  types_doc.rdb because all type info is already in the normal types.rdb, even
  the service nad singleton type info.
  In the same step i have updated the reference type library with the rdb of 
  OOo2.0.1 and have patched the following singleton types to ensure that we need 
  only one type ibrary:
    - com.sun.star.script.browse.theBrowseNodeFactory
    - com.sun.star.script.provider.theMasterScriptProviderFactory
    - com.sun.star.util.theMacroExpander
    - com.sun.star.util.theOfficeInstallationDirectories
  
01/25/06 (JSC): TaskID=i49101
  adapt com.sun.star.text.GenericTextDocument service. Insert support of 
  com.sun.star.lang.XMultiServiceFactory because this interface was missing but 
  is substantial for text documents and was implemented from the beginning.
