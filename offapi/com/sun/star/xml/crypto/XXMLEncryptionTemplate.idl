/**
 * Interface of XML encryption template
 *
 * <p>This interface represents a encryption template, which is the same as the 
 * desired xml encryption element[ EncryptedType ] but some of the nodes may be
 * empty. The empty entities include CipherValue, which is a subset of
 * EncryptedData or EncryptedKey. Empty entities are not allowed in a encryption
 * template when performing decryption.</p>
 *
 * <p>In some cases, the encrypter or decrypter can dertermine and locate the
 * EncrytedKey from the encryption template by dereference the RetrievalMethod
 * inside EncryptedData.</p>
 *
 * <p>In some cases, the EncryptedKey need to be clearly pointed out by the
 * encryption template.</p>
 *
 * <p>With the help of encryption context, the encrypter or decrypter specifies
 * the key from the KeyInfo in the encryption template.</p>   
 *
 *
 * <p>It isn't a good method to set the EncryptedKey here. In general, there is
 * a RetrievalMethod in EncryptedData by which we can get the EncryptedKey.
 *
 * And some times, in the low level, it is hard to determine what the key is
 * except that the high level application tell the mechanism and parameters.
 *
 * So I think it will be more simple that the application set the encrypted key
 * information. In this case, the application only need to know the xml schema
 * or DTD and the encryption device. If so, the high level application takes the
 * action of build the EncryptedKey template and references it in the element of
 * EncryptedData. And in this case, the calling to set up EncryptedKey template
 * and target is not necessary, because the encrypter or decrypter can determine
 * and locate the EncrypedKet from the encryption template of EncryptedData by
 * dereference the RetrievalMethod.
 *
 * In some situation, the high level applications do not want to know anything
 * about crypto devices( May be he must, because the lower level do not know
 * what the key is ). If it gives the key value, it can get EncryptedKey by
 * setting the key template and key value target.</p>
