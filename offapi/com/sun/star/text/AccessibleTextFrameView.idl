    /** This interface gives access to any paragraph fragment and table 
        fragment that is contained in a text frame and at least
        partially visible on the screen.
        
        <ul>
            <li>The parent returned by <type>getAccessibleParent</type>
                is the accessible view of a paragraph if the text frame
                is bound as character, and the accessible view (or of a page
                in the page preview) of the document in any other case.
            <li>The children returned by <type>getAccessibleChild</type> all
                support the interface XAccessible. Calling 
                <type>getAccessibleContext</type> for these children returns
                an object that supports one of the following services.
                <ul>
                    <li><type>com.sun.star.text.AccessibleParagraphView</type>:
                        A child of this kind is returned for every paragraph
                        fragment that is contained in the document body and
                        is at least partially visible. A paragraph fragment is
                        the part of a paragraph that is displayed on a
                        certain page or a certain column.
                    <li><type>com.sun.star.table.AccessibleTableView</type>:
                        A child of this kind is returned for every table
                        fragment that is contained in the document body
                        and is at least partially visible. A table fragment is
                        the part of a table that is displayed on a certain page 
                        or a certain column.
                </ul>
                <p>The logical order of paragraph and table fragments is never
                   changed.
            <li>The role is <type>TEXT_FRAME</type>
            <li>The name is the one assigned to the text frame in the text
                document. This means that it is not internationalized.
            <li>The description is the one assigned to the text frame in the
                text document. This means that it is not internationalized. If
                no description has been set, the description equals the name.
            <li>There are no relations.
            <li>The following states might be contained in the state set
                returned by <type>getAccessibleStateSet</type>:
                <ul>
                    <li><type>DEFUNC</type> (indicates that the document
                        window has been closed or the graphic is
                        not existing any longer)
                    <li><type>EDITABLE</type>
                    <li><type>ENABLED</type> (always contained)
                    <li><type>OPAQUE</type>
                    <li><type>SELECTABLE</type>
                    <li><type>SELECTED</type>
                    <li><type>FOCUSABLE</type>
                    <li><type>FOCUSED</type>
                    <li><type>SHOWING</type>
                    <li><type>VISIBLE</type>
                </ul>
            <li>The locale is the one the text document itself.
            <li>There are the two relations CONTENT_FLOWS_FROM and
                CONTENT_FLOWS_TO supported.
        </ul>
