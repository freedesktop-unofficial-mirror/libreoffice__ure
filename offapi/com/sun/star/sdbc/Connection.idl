/** represents a connection (session) with a specific

    executed and results are returned.
    
    <p>
    A Connection's database is able to provide information
    describing its tables, its supported SQL grammar, its stored
    procedures, and the capabilities of this connection. This
    information is obtained with the 
    <member scope="com::sun::star::sdbc">XConnection::getMetaData()</member>
    method.

    <b>
    Note:
    </b>
    By default the Connection automatically commits
    changes after executing each statement. If auto commit has been
    disabled, an explicit commit must be done or database changes will
    not be saved.
