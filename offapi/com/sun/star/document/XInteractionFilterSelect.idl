/** continuation used by interaction mechanism at filter detection during
    loading documents

    <p>
    If during loading time the filter can't be detected and wasn't given at calling time,
    a possible <type scope="com::sun::star::task">InteractionHandler</type> will be used.
    (it's a a part of used <type>MediaDescriptor</type>)
    A <type>NoSuchFilterRequest</type> will be used then to start right interaction on that to
    get a decision wich filter should be used for given URL. A possible continiuation
    of that can be this XInteractionFilterSelect. It will transport the decision back to
    generic filter detection and force using of it. Of course it's possible to abort
    the loading process by use another continuation <type scope="com::sun::star::task">XInteractionAbort</type>.
    </p>
