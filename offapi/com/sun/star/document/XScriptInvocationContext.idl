/** indicates support for executing scripts contained in a, possibly foreign, document.

    <p>If the component implementing it is a document, which supports embedding scripts into
    itself, then <member>ScriptContainer</member> refers to the document itself. Implementing this
    interface is unnecessary then, instead the document should simply implement <type>XEmbeddedScripts</type> directly.</p>

    <p>If the interface is implemented by a document which does not itself support embedding
    scripts into it, but which  is associated unambiguously with a document which does,
    then this other document is denoted by <member>ScriptContainer</member>.</p>

    <p>If the interface is implemented by a controller, then <member>ScriptContainer</member>
    refers to the document which supports embedding scripts, and which is unambiguosly
    associated with the controller. This must not necessarily be the model returned by
    <member scope="com::sun::star::frame">XController::getModel</member>.</p>
