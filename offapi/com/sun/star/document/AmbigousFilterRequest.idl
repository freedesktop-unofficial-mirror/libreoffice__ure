    This exception indicates, that generic filter detection can't decide which of
    two filters is the right one. In this case an interaction will be made.
    Given URL can be used to decide between given two filters.
    Decision can be made e.g. by a dialog, on which the user must select one
    of these filters.

    transport this decision back to source of started interaction.
