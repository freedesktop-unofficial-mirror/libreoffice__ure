/** could be used as an extension for performing data definition tasks on
    databases, and to control the access rights on database objects.
    
    
    <p>
    It may be implemented by a database driver provider, to encapsulate the
    complexity of data definition, and to give a common way for data definition as
    the DDL of most DBMS's differs.
    </p>
    <p>
    At least, the access to the tables of a database should be implemented.
    The implementation of other known database objects like views is optional.
    </p>
    <p>
    To control the access rights of users, there is the possibility to
    implement objects like users and groups.
