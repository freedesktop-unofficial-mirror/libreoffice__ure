    the controller of the Smalltalk model view controller design.</p>
    
    <p>You must set a model and a stub to the UnoControl before using 
    other methods.  The implementation only allows the change of the 
    graphics (<type>XView</type>) if the window is not visible. The 
    change of the graphics in visible state should redirect the output 
    to these graphics, but this behavior is implementation-specific.</p>
    
    <p>The change of data directly at the control may not affect the 
    model data. To ensure this behavior, modify the data of the model.</p>
