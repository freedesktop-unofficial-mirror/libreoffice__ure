    <p>This high-level event is generated by a component (such as a Button)
    when the component-specific action occurs (such as being pressed). 
    The event is passed to every every <type>XActionListener</type> object 
    that registered to receive such events using the component's 
    <code>addActionListener</code> method.

    gets this ActionEvent when the event occurs. The listener is therefore 
    spared the details of processing individual mouse movements and mouse 
    clicks, and can instead process a "meaningful" (semantic) event like 
    "button pressed". </p>
