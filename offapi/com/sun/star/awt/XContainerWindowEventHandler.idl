    /** Handles an event generated by a window.

        The implementation must be aware that the EventObject argument contains types
        which it is not prepared to handle. Similarly this applies for the MethodName
        argument. In this case the method should simply return false.

        @param xWindow
            the window instance that generated the event. If used in the scope of
            <type scope="com::sun::star::awt">XContainerWindowProvider</type> this
            is the same window instance that was returned by the createContainerWindow
            method when passing the XContainerWindowEventHandler instance receiving the 
            event as handler parameter.

        @param EventObject
            an object describing the event which occurred in the window or anything else that
            provides additional information for the event.
            If the event was caused by the window or any of the controls which it contains
            then the any should contain an object derived from
            <type scope="com::sun::star::lang">EventObject</type>. Typically this would be one
            of the several com::sun::star::awt::*Event types.

        @param MethodName
            the name of the function which is to be called.
            
        @returns
            true if the event was handled, otherwise false.

        @throws com::sun::star::lang::WrappedTargetException  
            if the implementation of the method, which is determined by the argument MethodName,
            throws an exception. This exception is then wrapped into a
            <type scope="com::sun::star::lang">WrappedTargetException</type>.
