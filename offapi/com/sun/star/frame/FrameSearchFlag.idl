            Normaly it's interpreted as search on the direct childs of the parent
            only. But in combination with e.g. the CHILDREN flag it can include all
            children of it too.

        /** allow the search outside the current sub task tree of the whole possible frame tree

        <p>
        If this flag isn't present, any search from bottom to top has to stop, if a top frame
        will be reached. It doesn't influence a search from top to bottom.
        But it can be used at the root of the frame tree to search on direct childrens of it only.
        Because the direct children of the root node are the root's of the task sub trees, which
        are top frames too. Instead of using the CHILDREN flag there, it's possible so to supress
        a deeper search so.
