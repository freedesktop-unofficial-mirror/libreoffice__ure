/** The SessionManager service provides an interface to the session manager
    of the desktop. A session manager keeps track of applications that are
    running when the desktop shuts down and starts them again in the same
    state they were left when the desktop starts up the next time. To be able
    to do this the session manager needs cooperation from applications;
    applications have to provide sufficient information to be started again as
    well as restore the state they were left in. The normal flow of operation
    looks like this:

    <ol>
    <li>The user starts the desktop shutdown.</li>
    <li>The session manager informs all its connected applications
    about the pending shutdown.</li>
    <li>Each application saves its current state; while doing this it may
        <ul>
        <li>The application may request to interact with the user (e.g. to ask
        where to save documents). This request is necessary because at any one
        time only one application can iteract with the user. The session manager
        coordinates these requests and grants every application in need of user
        interaction a timeslot in which it may interact with the user</li>
        <li>try to cancel the whole shutdown; the session manager may or may
        not honor that request.</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
     <li>After saving is done the session manager signals all applications
     to exit.</li>
     <li>Applications answer the exit message by disconnecting from the
     session manager.</li>
     <li>After all applications have exited or a reasonable timeout the
     session manager kills all remaining applications and finally lets the
     desktop shut down.</li>
