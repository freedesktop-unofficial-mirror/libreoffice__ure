        <p>Though there is a 1-to-1 relationship between database documents and data sources,
        each of the two can exist without its counterpart, but create this counterpart on request
        only. As a consequence, the document obtained via this attribute might be newly created,
        which implies that the caller is now responsible for it. In particular, the caller is
        responsible for calling <member scope="com::sun::star::util">XCloseable::close</member>
        on the document as soon as it's not needed anymore.</p>

        <p>Additionally, if the caller does long-lasting processing on the document, it's advised
        to add itself as <type scope="com::sun::star::util">XCloseListener</type> to the document,
        to prevent closing as long as the processing lasts.</p>
