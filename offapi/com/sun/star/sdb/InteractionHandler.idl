/**	is a service for user interaction for databases.
    <p>
    interaction requests that the handler can provide are:
    <ul>
        <li><b>database related errors</b><br/>
            The general structure to transport such errors is the 
            <type scope="com::sun::star::sdbc">SQLException</type>
            , and if your 
            <type scope="com::sun::star::task">XInteractionRequest</type>
            supplies such a 
            <type scope="com::sun::star::sdbc">SQLException</type>
            (or an instance of any derived class), 
            the handler will display a generic error dialog, which is able
            to travel the object chain which may be contained in the exception.
        </li>
        <li><b>authentication</b><br/>
            If your 
            <type scope="com::sun::star::task">XInteractionRequest</type>
            (see 
            <member scope="com::sun::star::task">XInteractionHandler::handle()</member>
            ) supplies a
            <type scope="com::sun::star::ucb">AuthenticationRequest</type>
            , the handler will open a standard login
            dialog to allow user authentication.
            <br/>
            Besides the using the members of the AuthenticationRequest in the usual manner, the member <em>Server</em>
            (if not empty) is interpreted as datasource name, thus leading to a slightly different message when
            requesting the user to enter it's login data.
            <br/>
            In the case you want to use this authentication feature, you should supply a special authentication
            continuation (
            <type scope="com::sun::star::ucb">XInteractionSupplyAuthentication</type>
            ) as well, so the
            handler can return to you, the entered information.
        </li>
        <li><b>parameter requests</b><br/>
            If your 
            <type scope="com::sun::star::task">XInteractionRequest</type>
            supplies an
            <type scope="com::sun::star::sdb">ParametersRequest</type>
            , the handler will open a standard dialog asking
            the user to fill in parameter values.
            <br/>
            In the case you want to use this feature of the handler, you should supply a special continuation
            (
            <type scope="com::sun::star::sdb">XInteractionSupplyParameters</type>
            ) as well, so the
            handler can return to you, the entered information.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
