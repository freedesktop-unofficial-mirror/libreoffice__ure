        <p>Parameters (passed to the method 
        <member scope="com::sun::star::lang">XInitialization::initialize</member>)
        have to be instances of <type scope="com::sun::star::beans">PropertyValue</type>, where the
        <member scope="com::sun::star::beans">PropertyValue::Name</member> member specifies what the parameter controls,
        with the <member scope="com::sun::star::beans">PropertyValue::Value</member> member containing the value
        to be used.<br>
        Recognized parameters are:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Frame</b><br>
            has to be an <type scope="com::sun::star::frame">XFrame</type> interface specifying the frame to plug the
            QueryDesign component into.
            </li>
            <li><b>DataSourceName</b><br>
            The name of the globally registered <service>DataSource</service> to be used for initial display. It is only
            meaningful together with the other parameters specifying the object to display.
            </li>
            <li><b>CurrentQuery</b><br>
            This is a string giving the name of the object to display initially. 
            </li>
            <li><b>QueryDesignView</b><br>
            This value indicates if the QueryDesign should be opened in the design view or in the text view.
            If set to </TRUE> than the design view will be displayed otherwise the text view will appear.
            </li>
