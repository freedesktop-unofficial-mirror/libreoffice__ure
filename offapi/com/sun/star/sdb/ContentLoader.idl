        <p>Supporting this service ensures that you can plug any of the components
        the loader can create into an arbitrary frame.</p>

        The loader should be registered for the URL scheme <b>.component:DB/ *</b>, 
        the concrete URLs supported are:
        <ul>
            <li><b>.component:DB/DataSourceBrowser</b><br/>
                Using this URL creates an instance of the <service>DataSourceBrowser</service> service 
                and plugs it into the frame passed to the loader.
            </li>
            <li><b>.component:DB/FormGridView</b><br/>
                Using this URL creates an instance of the <service>ExternalSourceBrowser</service> service 
                and plugs	it into the frame passed to the loader.
            </li>
        </ul>

        The parameters passed to the <member scope="com::sun::star::frame">XFrameLoader::load</member> are forwarded
