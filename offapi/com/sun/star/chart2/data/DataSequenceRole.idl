/** a string that states in what way a <type>DataSequence</type>
    should be used.  If this property is an empty string, no
    proposition about usage is made.

    <p>The strings can have any value.  However some values are
    predefined and should always be interpreted in the same way.</p>

    <dl>
     <dt>label</dt>
       <dd>values are used as a label for a series.  Usually, you
           will have just one cell containing a string.</dd>
     <dt>values-x</dt>
       <dd>values are used as x-values in an XY- or bubble
           diagram</dd>
     <dt>values-y</dt>
       <dd>values are used as y-values in an XY-Diagram or as values
           in a bar, line, etc. chart</dd>
     <dt>values-z</dt>
       <dd>values may be used as z-values in a three-dimensional
           XYZ-Diagram or a surface-chart</dd>
     <dt>sizes</dt>
       <dd>values are used as radius of the bubbles in a
           Bubble-Diagram</dd>
     <dt>error-bars-x</dt>
       <dd>values are used as error-information in x-direction for
           displaying error-bars</dd>
     <dt>error-bars-y</dt>
       <dd>values are used as error-information in y-direction for
           displaying error-bars</dd>
     <dt>categories</dt>
       <dd>values are used for categories in the diagram</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>In a candle-stick chart you have the following roles:</p>

    <dl>
     <dt>values-first</dt>
      <dd>the first value of a series of values.  In a stock-chart this
          would be the opening course.</dd>
     <dt>values-last</dt>
      <dd>the last value of a series of values.  In a stock-chart this
          would be the closing course.</dd>
     <dt>values-min</dt>
      <dd>the minimum value of a series of values.  In a stock-chart
          this would be the lowest course that occured during
          trading.</dd>
     <dt>values-max</dt>
      <dd>the maximum value of a series of values.  In a stock-chart
          this would be the highest course that occured during
          trading.</dd>
