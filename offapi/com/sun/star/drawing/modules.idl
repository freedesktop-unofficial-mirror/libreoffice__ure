/** The drawing framework is responsible for managing the resources used by
    the UI of the drawing applications.
    <p>The framework is implemented by a set of sub controllers that are
    responsible for its different resources: <type
    scope="com::sun::star::drawing::framework">XModuleController</type>,
    <type scope="com::sun::star::drawing::framework">XPaneController</type>,
    <type scope="com::sun::star::drawing::framework">XViewController</type>,
    <type scope="com::sun::star::drawing::framework">XToolbarController</type>,
    <type scope="com::sun::star::drawing::framework">XCommandController</type>.
    The set of active resources is represented by the <type
    scope="com::sun::star::drawing::framework">XConfiguration</type>.</p>
    <p>The <type
    scope="com::sun::star::drawing::framework">XControllerManager</type>
    interface provides access to the sub controllers.  It typically is
    implemented by the same class that implements the <type
    scope=:com::sun::star::frame">XController</type> interface.</p>
    <p>The
    configuration is managed by the <type
    scope="com::sun::star::drawing::framework">XConfigurationController</type>.
    It coordinates changes to the configuration made by the other sub
    controllers so that
    <ul><li>unnecessary ui updates (flickering) is avoided and</li>
    <li>and the configuration is always in a valid and meaningfull
    state.</li></ul>
