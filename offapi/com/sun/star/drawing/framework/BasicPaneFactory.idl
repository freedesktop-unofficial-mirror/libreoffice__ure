    pane there are two URLS, <code>private:resource/floater/LeftImpressPane</code>
    and <code>private:resource/floater/LeftDrawPane</code>, one for Impress,
    the other for Draw.  The center pane and the right pane have the URLs
    <code>private:resource/floater/CenterPane</code> and
    <code>private:resource/floater/RightPane</code> respectively.</p>
