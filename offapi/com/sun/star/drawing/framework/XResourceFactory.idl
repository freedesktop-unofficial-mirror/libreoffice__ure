            create.  The anchor can be used to obtain the associated object
            from the configuration controller.  For example, when a view is
            created, then the new object can be initialized with the pane
            that is its anchor.

            be successfull.  This, for example, can be the case with SFX
            based side panes.  They are not available right after the
