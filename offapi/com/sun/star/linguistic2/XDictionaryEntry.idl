    and indicate if it is a negative word.
    If it is a negative entry it may supply a replacement text to
    be used instead of the entry word.</P>

     <P>Hyphenation positions are represented by an '=' in the word.
     If the '=' is the last character of the word this means it should not
     be hyphenated. If there is no '=' charcter in the word, hyphenation
     positions will be determined automatically (i.e., from the hyphenator
    service alone).</P>

     <P>Entries whose words only differ in hyphenation are considered
     to be equal. Also a '.' at the end of the word will make no
     difference.</P>
