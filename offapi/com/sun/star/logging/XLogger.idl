/** implemented by a component which is able to log events.

    <p>This interface is roughly designed after the
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html">Java
    Logging API</a>. However, there are some differences, the major ones being:
    <ul><li>There's no support (yet) for filtering log events.</li>
        <li>There ain't no convenience menthods for logging.</li>
        <li>There's no localization support.</li>
        <li>Logger instances do not form a hierarchy.</li>
    </ul></p>
