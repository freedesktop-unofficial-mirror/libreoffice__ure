/**	The <type>Package</type> is a service that provides access to a set of
    files and folders contained within a Package. One instance of the 
    Package service exists for each Package file to be manipulated.

    Each instance is created with an argument which specifies the URL of 
    the Package file to which the user requires access. If the instance is
    created without arguments, it must be initialised with the 
    <type>XInitialization</type> service methods before it is a valid 
    instance of the service.

    This is also used to get access to a particular folder within the
    Package. For example:

    This interface is used to create new PackageStream or PackageFolder
    implementation objects for addition to the Package.

    createInstance - creates a new stream implementation object (when first
    created, the new object is not part of the Package. It must be added
    to the PackageFolder in which it will reside using the methods in the
    PackageFolder service.

    createInstanceWithArguments - This accepts one boolean value as an
    argument. If it set to true, we create a PackageFolder implementation,
    if it is set to false, we create a PackageStream implementation.

    Creating and inserting a new stream would be done as follows:

        1. xNewStream = package->createInstanceWithArguments( false );
        2. xDataStream = new MyStreamImpl(). (wherever the data comes from)
        3. xNewStream->setInputStream( xDataStream );
        4. parentFolder->insertByName( "image.png", xNewStream );
    
    Replacing an existing stream would be very similar, except that the
    call ->insertByName would be replaced by ->replaceByName.
