        <p>
        This call needs careful usage as data loss can occur. If the 
        implementation has modified data and a new storage is set the 
        implementation is not allowed to write back the data to the old
        storage. This must be done explicitly with <member>store</member>.
        In general a user interface configuration manager instance is 
        created and initialize by the document model or the module user 
        interface configuration supplier. Normally there is no need to 
        set a storage for a user interface configuration manager. If a 
        copy of the configuration data to another storage should be made, 
        use <member>storeToStorage</member>.
