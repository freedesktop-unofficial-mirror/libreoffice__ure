        <p>
        An implementation must provide a <type scope="com::sun::star::uno">Sequence</type> which
        has <type scope="com::sun::star::beans">PropertyValue</type> as entries. The following
        entries a defined:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Label</b><br>a string which specifies the short name of the user interface command with 
            mnemonic and optional subsequent ... if the command needs additional user input. This string
            can directly be used to set the text of a menu item.</li>
            <li><b>Name</b><br>a string which specifies the short name of the user interface command without 
            any additional information. It can be used for the bubble help.</li>
            <li><b>Popup</b><br>a boolean which specifies if the user interface command is a unique
            identifer for a popup menu. A popup menu has a label, but is not bound to a command.</li>
        </ul>
        The key to a user interface command description is the user interface command itself which has
        the following syntax ".uno:$Command". For example ".uno:Open" shows the file open dialog.
        A complete list of user interface commands can be found inside the latest OpenOffice Developers Guide 
        or online at http://framework.openoffice.org.
