        functionality of this interface could be simulated by using setting some properties manually,
        <method scope="com::sun::star::sdbc">XRowSet::execute</method>, moving the row set cursor and so on.</p>

        <p>One main difference between <method>XLoadable::load</method> and <method scope="com::sun::star::sdbc">XRowSet::execute</method>
        is that if you use the former, the row set is positioned on the first record, while in the latter case
        it is position <em>before</em> the it.</p>

        mechanisms. An example for this (and currently the only one) are parameter values.</p>

        additional data.</p>

        to a form to get notified whenever the form needs parameter values to be filled in<br/>
        In a first approach, the form tries to fill any parameters from it's master-detail relation
        (if any). All values which can't be filled are then passed to all listeners, which can
        fill them by their own choice.</p>

        <p>This is sligtly changed if the form is loaded using the
        <member scope="com::sun::star::sdb">XCompletedExecution::connectWithCompletion</member> method. In this case, the parameters
        are obtained from the interaction handler, not from the listeners</p>

        which are related to the master fields of the parent form.

        <p>Entries in this sequence can either denote column names in the sub form,
        or paramater names.<br/>
        For instance, you could base the form on the SQL statement
        <code>SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE cust_ref = :cid</code>, and add <code>cid</code>
        to the DetailFields property. In this case, the parameter will be filled from
        the corresponding master field.<br/>
        Alternatively, you could simply base your form on the table <code>invoices</code>,
        and add the column name <code>cust_ref</code> to the DetailFields. In this case,
        and implicit filter clause <code>WHERE cust_ref = :&lt;new_param_name&gt;</code> will
        be created, and the artificial parameter will be filled from the corresponding
        master field.<br/>
        If a string in this property denotes both a column name and a parameter name, it
        is undefined which way it is interpreted, but implementations of the service are required
        to either decide for the paramter or the column, and proceed as usual.
