/**	specifies a (form) component which is bound to a data source.
    
    <p>The interface provides the possibility of committing its respective
    data to a data source it is bound to. A <member>commit</member> will be
    performed by the environment (usually, a <type>FormController</type>).<br/>
    For example, suppose you have a data-bound control that is connected
    to a database field. Each time the control loses its focus, the
    model (component) of the control is triggered by the environment
    to store its value in the database field.</p>

    <p>A commit may fail if an <type>XUpdateListener</type> vetoes the it.</p>
