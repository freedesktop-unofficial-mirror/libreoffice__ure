/** specifies a component which can be used to dispatch form controller functionality.

    <p>A form controller dispatcher is an instance which provides access to dispatchers
    (<type scope="com::sun::star::frame">XDispatch</type>) for certain form controller
    functionality.</p>

    <p>The way how access to these dispatchers is provided is not defined. It may either
    be directly via an <type scope="com::sun::star::frame">XDispatchProvider</type> interface,
    or indirectly, e.g. by registering dispatch interceptors (<type scope="com::sun::star::frame">XDispatchProviderInterceptor</type>)
    at another instance which supports this (by exposing the <type scope="com::sun::star::frame">XDispatchProviderInterception</type>
    interface).</p>

    <p>In any scenario, foreign components have a (implicit or explicit) possibility to request a dispatcher
    for a given URL.</p>

    <p>Below, there's a list of URLs which have a defined meaning - if a <type>FormControllerDispatcher</type>
    implementation supports one of them, there must be a guaranteed semantices. However, concrete implementations
    may support an arbitrary sub or super set of these URLs.</p>

    <p>In general, all URLs start with the same prefix, namely <em>.uno:FormController/</em>. To this, a suffix is
    appended which describes the requested functionality.<br/>
    Example: The URL suffix for deleting the current record is <em>deleteRecord</em>, so the complete URL for
    requesting a dispatcher for this functionality is <em>.uno:FormController/deleteRecord</em>.</p>

    <p>Some URLs may require parameters. For this, the sequence of <type scope="com::sun::star::beans">PropertyValue</type>s
    passed to the <member scope="com::sun::star::frame">XDispatch::dispatch</member> call is used - every property value is
    used as one named parameter.</p>

    <p>For all URLs, interested parties can register as status listeners (<type scope="com::sun::star::frame">XStatusListener</type>)
    at the dispatchers, and be notified whenever the functionality associated with the URL becomes enabled or
    disabled.<br/>
    For instance, the URL with the suffix <em>moveToFirst</em> is associated with moving the form to the first
    record, and it will be disabled in case the form is already positioned on the first record.</p>

    <p>Nearly all of the functionality offered by a <type>FormControllerDispatcher</type> can also be
    reached by other means. E.g., moving a form to its first record can be achieved by calling the
    method <member scope="com::sun::star::sdbc">XResultSet::first</member> of the form.<br/>
    However, the advantage of using a <type>FormControllerDispatcher</type> is that it's usually implemented
    by a component which has additional knowledge about the form. For instance, in a document which
    displays a form, there might be a control which contains uncommitted changes, plus a control
    whose changes were already committed to the current record, but <em>not</em> to the database. Simply
    calling <member scope="com::sun::star::sdbc">XResultSet::first</member> on the form would lose
    both the content in the uncommitted control, and the changes in the current record.<br/>
    An <type>FormControllerDispatcher</type> is expected to care for both of these.</p>

        <td>positions the form on a record given by absolute number.<br/>
        There's one parameter for this functionality, named <em>Position</em>, which must be a long

        use the dispatcher to add as <type scope="com::sun::star::frame">XStatusListener</type>, and be
        notified when the record count changes.<br/>
        The status value which is being notified (<member scope="com::sun::star::frame">FeatureStateEvent::State</member>)
        is a string which can be used to display the record count. In particular, if the record count is not yet known
        (<member scope="com::sun::star::sdb">RowSet::IsRowCountFinal</member> is <FALSE/>), this is indicated in the
        string, too.</td>
