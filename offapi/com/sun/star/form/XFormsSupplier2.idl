        <p>If you need read access to the forms collection, then you might check

        <FALSE/>, you can do as if <member>XFormsSupplier::getForms</member> would
        have returned an empty container.</p>

        <p>Semantically, <member>hasForms</member> is equivalent to calling
        <member>XElementAccess::hasElements</member> on the container returned by
        <member>XFormsSupplier::getForms</member>. But when using the latter, the
        implementation is forced to create a empty container, which might be potentially
        expensive.</p>
