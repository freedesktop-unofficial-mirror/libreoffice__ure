/** provides functionality to control the activation of forms controls.

    <p>There is a duality of forms (<type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">DataForm</type>)
    and form controllers. In a document view, for every loaded form there is a form controller which is
    responsible	for exactly the controls which's models are direct children of the form.<br/>

    In some sense, a form controller is the view representation of a form, like a <em>form control</em> is the
    view representation of a <em>form control model</em>.<br/>

    This is also reflected in this interface: If you call
    <method scope="com::sun::star::awt">XTabController::getModel</method> on a form controller, the form which
    the controller is responsible for will be returned.<br/>

    As always in the model-view-paradigm, there is no way from a model to its controller, mostly, because for
    <em>one</em> given form, there is one controller for <em>every</em> view of the document.</p>

    <p>A controller is called <em>active</em> if one of the controls it is responsible for has the focus,
    else inactive. To be notified whenever this activation state of a given controller changes, you can
    add listeners.</p>
