        init should be called only once for contexts which don't support
        mutual authentication and at most twice for contexts which do
        support mutual authentication. Additional calls produce undefined
        results.

        @param Token
        the SSO token received from the acceptor side in response to an
        authentication request. This token is ignored on the first call
        to init and should only be specified for the second call on a
        context supporting mutual authentication.

        @returns
        the sequence of bytes to be sent to the acceptor side as part of
        an authentication request. This sequence will be non zero length
        for the first call to init, zero length for the second call to init
        on a context supporting mutual authentication and undefined in all
        other cases.
