/** provides update control for a hierarchy of configuration items
 and information about the hierarchy as a whole as well as its root.
 
 <p>Extends <type>AccessRootElement</type> by adding support for
 collecting changes and applying them to a backend store as a single batch.
 </p>

 <p>An implementation represents the root of a partial hierarchy. [See the
 documentation for <type>AccessRootElement</type>]. The hierarchy in turn is
 a <em>view</em> onto a fragment of persistent data tree that can be accessed
 through several such views, or even several processes, simultaneously.
 </p>

 <p>Elements of the hierarchy, such as descendants of this root element,
 may support modification by providing appropriate
 interfaces. Changes done this way initially only affect these objects
 themselves and other objects within the same hierarchy, such as other
 descendants of this root element.
 </p>

 <p>The accumulated changes within this hierarchy can be managed using
 <type scope="com::sun::star::util">XChangesBatch</type>. Pending changes
 will become persistent and visible from other overlapping hierarchies
 only when <member scope="com::sun::star::util">XChangesBatch::commitChanges()</member>
 is called. If the hierarchy is disposed or discarded without committing
 changes, the changes will be lost.
 </p>

 indirect) descendants of this element. The same set of changes is committed
 to persistent storage and/or made visible to other objects accessing the same
 data set, when 
 <member scope="com::sun::star::util">XChangesBatch::commitChanges()</member>
 is invoked.

 <p>If the implementation supports
 <member scope="com::sun::star::lang">XLocalizable::setLocale()</member>, changes
 will be considered to apply to the locale that is set when
