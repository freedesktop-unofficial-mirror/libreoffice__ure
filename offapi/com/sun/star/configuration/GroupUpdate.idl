 <type>PropertyHierarchy</type> (from <type>GroupAccess</type>), so that
 <code>xGroup.setPropertyValue( aName, aValue )</code> is equivalent to
 <code>xGroup.replaceByName( aName, aValue )</code>.

 <type scope="com::sun::star::beans">XPropertySet</type> or
 <type scope="com::sun::star::beans">XMultiPropertySet</type>.
 </p>

 <p>Elements of this group may be replaced only if they are of simple type.
 The type returned by
 <member scope="com::sun::star::container">XElementAccess::getElementType()</member>
 must not be an interface type. Replacing whole subtrees is not supported.
