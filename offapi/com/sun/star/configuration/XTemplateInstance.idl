/** implemented by objects that are instances of a named template.

    <p>	Template names are similar service names, but apply to structure and
        content, rather than to type.
    </p>
    <p>	Often a template description can be retrieved from a repository, and then be 
        interpreted by a factory object. So templates provide a means to build 
        new kinds of objects dynamically.
