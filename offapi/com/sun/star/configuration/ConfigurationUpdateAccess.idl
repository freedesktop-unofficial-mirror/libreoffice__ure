/** provides modifying access to a fragment of the configuration hierarchy.

 <p>Extends <type>ConfigurationAccess</type> to support modifying values
 or inserting and removing elements.
 </p>

 <p>Descendants of this service also implement this service
 unless they are marked <em>read-only</em> in the
 schema (which is indicated by attribute
 <const scope="com::sun::star::beans">PropertyAttribute::READONLY</const>),
 in which case they only need implement <type>ConfigurationAccess</type>.

 <!-- Dennis: "(and so on recursively)" needs to be rewritten. -->
 <!-- Dennis: only the @see is being displayed beyond this point. -->
 <!-- Developer: The current version is OK in the generated output. Preview problem ? -->

 <p>The classification of implementations that is described for
 <type>ConfigurationAccess</type> applies to implementations of this service
 as well. Therefore an implementation will support one of several alternate
 services describing its <em>Container</em> role and one of several alternate
 services describing its <em>Element</em> role. These services are
 extensions of the respective services documented for <type>ConfigurationAccess</type>.
 </p>
 <ul>
    <li><em>Container</em> role: 
        A <em>group</em> permits changing child values.
        A <em>set</em> permits inserting and removing contained elements.
    </li>
    <li><em>Element</em> role:
        The root element of a modifiable tree provides extended functionality
        to control processing of changes for the entire tree (fragment) by
        supporting <type scope="com::sun::star::util">XChangesBatch</type>.
        For elements of a <em>set</em> or a <em>group</em> no additinal
        interfaces are supported.
    </li>
 </ul>

    Root instances of this service can be requested from a
    <type>ConfigurationProvider</type>

     further specialized to support modifying access.
     Implementations shall therefore implement one of <type>SetUpdate</type> or
     <type>GroupUpdate</type> depending on the <em>Container</em> role.
     </p>

     <p>If the <type>HierarchyElement</type> specialization that is implemented
     is <type>AccessRootElement</type>, the implementation must support the
     extended functionality of <type>UpdateRootElement</type>. Otherwise, there
     are no new requirements mandated by the <em>Element</em> role.

 <!-- Developer: There are several similar services (here: SetUpdate and GroupUpdate). Exactly one
      of these alternatives is available. 
     How can I express that more concisely ? I tried to rephrase it. 
     I think your version is slightly misleading.
