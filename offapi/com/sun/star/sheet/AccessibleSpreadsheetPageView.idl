/** The accessible view of a spreadsheet page preview

 */
service AccessibleSpreadsheetPageView
{
    /** This interface gives access to any object that is at least partially
        visible on the screen in the page preview.

    <ul>
        <li>The parent returned by <type>getAccessibleParent</type>
            is the window wich contains the view of these page preview.</li>
        <li>The children returned by <type>getAccessibleChild</type> all
            support the interface XAccessible. Calling
            <type>getAccessibleContext</type> for these children returns
            an object that supports one of the following services.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><type>com.sun.star.text.AccessibleHeaderFooterAreaView</type>:
                A child where calling <type>getAccessibleChild</type>
                an object that supports this service is returned for
                every header and footer that is at least partially visible.</li>
            <li><type>com.sun.star.table.AccessibleTableView</type>:
                A child where calling <type>getAccessibleChild</type>
                an object that supports this service is returned for
                every table fragment that is contained in the document body
                and is at least partially visible. A table fragment is the
                part of a table that is displayed on a certain page.</li>
            <li><type>com.sun.star.drawing.AccessibleShape</type>:
                A child where calling <type>getAccessibleChild</type>
                an object that supports this service is returned
                for every shape that is at least partially visible. These
                objects are children of the
                <type>AccessibleSpreadsheetPageView</type> regardless
                whether they are bound to a table or a cell.</li>
            <li><type>com.sun.star.text.AccessibleParagraphView</type>:
                A child where calling <type>getAccessibleChild</type>
                an object that supports this service is returned for
                every note (its paragraphs) and its location (which is
                represented as a paragraph with the cell name as content).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following rules apply to the children order. General it
            represents the paint order. The object in the background came
            first and than all over lying objects. The last painted object
            is also the last child.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The logical order of paragraph and table fragments is never
                changed.</li>
            <li>Headers appear immediately before the first table fragment
                of the header's page.</li>
            <li>Footers appear immediately after the last table fragment.</li>
            <li>Shapes appear before any other children if they are painted
                in the background.  Their order reflects the z order.</li>
            <li>Shapes appear behind any other children except controls if
                they are painted in the foreground. Their order reflects the
                z order.</li>
            <li>Controls appear behind any other objects. Their order
                reflects the z order.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The description is ???.</li>
        <li>The name is Spreadsheet Document Page Preview.</li>
        <li>The role is <type>DOCUMENT</type></li>
        <li>There are no relations.</li>
        <li>The following states are supported:
            <ul>
                <li><type>DEFUNC</type> is always false until the preview is
                    closed.</li>
                <li><type>EDITABLE</type> is always false, because the document
                    is not editable in the page preview. So it is left out of
                    the list.</li>
                <li><type>ENABLED</type> is always true.</li>
                <li><type>MULTILINE</type> makes no sense on a document and so
                    it is left out of the list.</li>
                <li><type>MULTISELECTABLE</type> is always false, because in a
                    page preview a selection is not possible. So it is left out
                    of the list.</li>
                <li><type>OPAQUE</type> is always true.</li>
                <li><type>RESIZEABLE</type> is always false, because you can
                    resize the window of the page preview, but not the page
                    preview itself. So it is left out of the list.</li>
                <li><type>SELECTABLE</type> is always false, because in the
                    page preview is no selection possible. So it is left out of
                    the list.</li>
                <li><type>SELECTED</type> is always false, because in the
                    page preview is no selection possible. So it is left out of
                    the list.</li>
                <li><type>SHOWING</type>Is true if the Bounding Box lies in
                    the Bounding Box of the parent. Otherwise it is false.</li>
                <li><type>VISIBLE</type>Is always true.</li>

        </li>
