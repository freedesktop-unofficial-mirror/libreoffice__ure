        This value corresponds to the font height in Western scripts,

        <member>FontRequest::IsVertical</member> below). That
        means, the value specified here is always measured orthogonal
        to the text advancement (height for horizontal writing, and
        width for vertical writing).<p>

        When this value is negative, its absolute value is taken as
        the character size of the font. If this value is positive,
        it's taken as the cell size of the font.<p>

        This member and the referenceAdvancement member are mutually
        exclusive, one of them has to be set to 0 (which means don't
        care).<p>

        For distorted fonts, the render transformation must be
        used. That is, the size specified here corresponds to device
        pixel only if the combined render transformation during text
        output equals the identity transform. This also applies to all
        query methods, for both <type>XCanvasFont</type> and
        <type>XTextLayout</type>.<p>

        structure.<p>

        This member and the cellSize member are mutually exclusive,
