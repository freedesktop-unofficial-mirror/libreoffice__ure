        system, with its origin on screen being equal to its current
        position, the clip poly-polygon's origin will always coincide

        words, the closer to the screen surface the sprite is shown.<p>

        determining sprite rendering order. Avoid NaNs and other
        irregular floating point values here, the order position for
        sprites with such a priority value is undefined.
