        thus have values ranging from 0 up to the number of characters
        in the string. Hereby, an index of 0 denotes an insertion
        position <em>before</em> the first character, and an index
        containing the number of characters denotes an insertion
        <em>behind</em> the last character.<p>

        encounteres first when reading text of the corresponding
        language (i.e. the leading edge of an Arabic glyph is the
        right half of it, whereas it is the left half of a Latin
        character). If the hit was on the leading edge, this member is
        set to <TRUE>.
