    glyphs. The font height is defined as

    Please note that when querying FontMetrics from an XCanvasFont
    interface, all values here are given in device coordinates, and
    already tuned to the specific font size. That means, the
    referenceCharWidth and/or ascent+descent+internalLeading will
    approximately (rounded to integer device resolution, or exactly,
    if fractional font rendering is enabled) match the
    referenceAdvancement/cellSize members of the FontRequest for
    which the XCanvasFont was queried.
