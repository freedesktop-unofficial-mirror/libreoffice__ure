    of this executor. If somewhere could be found it will be

        <p>
        Jobs are registered in configuration and will be started by executor
        automaticly, if they are registered for triggered event.
        The meaning of given string <var>Event</var> mustn't be known. Because
        for the executor it's enough to use it for searching a registered job
        inside his own configuration. So no special events will be defined here.
