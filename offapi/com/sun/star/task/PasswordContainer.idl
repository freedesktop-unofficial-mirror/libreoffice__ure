/** this service is kind of storage that allows to store passwords 
    and to retrieve already stored.

    <P>
    A password can be stored for the session period or persistently. 
    The persistent way is only possible if configuration allows to use storage. 
    It stores passwords encripted with a super password. An interaction
    is used to ask a user for a super password.
    To allow such an interaction, an object that implements <type>XInteractionHandler</type> 
    interface should be provided. For this purpose <type>InteractionHandler</type> 
    service can be used.
    </P>

    <P>
    In case no interaction handler is provided all passwords are stored
    for the session period. In case an interaction handler is provided, but
    the super password interaction does not return super password ( for any reason ), 
    <type>NoMasterException</type> exception is thrown to let user use
    nonpersistent way explicitly.
    </P>
