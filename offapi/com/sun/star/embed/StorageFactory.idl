        call is used the result storage will be open in readwrite mode based

            <dt>parameter 1</dt>
            <dd>
                      specifies source of the object, it can be a string

                      to the storage so some parts can be used for
                      initialization, it can be for example

        <p>
        The parameters are optional, that means that sequence can be empty or
        contain only first parameter, or first and second one. In case
        no parameters are provided the call works the same way as
        <member scope="com::sun::star::lang">XSingleServiceFactory::createInstance</member>.
        In case only first parameter is provided, the storage is opened in
        readonly mode.
        </p>

        <p>
        The opened root storage can support read access in addition to
        specified one.
