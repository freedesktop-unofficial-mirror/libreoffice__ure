    /** A storage can be created through this interface.
        In case <type>XSingleServiceFactory</type>::createInstance() call is used
    the result storage will be open in readwrite mode based on an arbitrary medium.
        In case <type>XSingleServiceFactory</type>::createInstanceWithArguments() call is used
    a sequence of the following parameters can be used:
        parameter 1 - specifies source of the object, it can be a string containing URL,
                      an <type>XStream</type> implementation or <type>XInputStream</type>;
                      in case of <type>XStream</type> implementation the <type>XSeekable</type>
                      interface must be supported.
        parameter 2 - specifies mode the storage should be open in, can take values from 
                      <type>ElementModes</type> constant set.
        parameter 3 - allowes to provide <type>MediaDescryptor</type> to the storage so some parts
                      can be used for initialization, it can be for example <type>XInteractionHandler</type>
                      implementation, password for the storage and repair package flag;
    The parameters are optional, that means that sequence can be empty or contain only first parameter,
    or first and second one. In case no parameters are provided the call works the same way as
    <type>XSingleServiceFactory</type>::createInstance(). In case only first parameter is provided,
    the storage is opened in readonly mode.
        The opened root storage can support read access in addition to specified one.
