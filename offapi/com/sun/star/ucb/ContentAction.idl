/** specifies actions which can be transported with content events.

    <p>
    The situations under which contents will send ContentEvents of the various
    action types are described below.  The description is broken into a list of
    useful definitions, a list of events that happen to contents, and a list of
    reactions taken by contents in response to those events.
    </p>

    <p>
    The definitions are as follows:
    </p>

    <table border =1>
    <tr><td>D1</td><td>A content C has an identifier id(C).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>D2</td><td>A content C is in one of two states, Alive or Deleted.
                       </td></tr>
    <tr><td>D3</td><td>A folder content F has a set of children H(F) that is a
                       set of content identifiers. For example, an "open"
                       command will usualy return a	subset of the contents
                       denoted by H(F).</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    The events that can happen to contents (and that are of interest in this
    context) are listed next.  Note that 'event' here does not mean an
    ContentEvent, but rather some event that occurs either because some	content
    processes a command, or because a content gets informed about a relevant
    change in the underlying system it represents.
    </p>

    <table border =1>
    <tr><td>E1</td><td>The identifier of a content C changes from id1(C) == A
                       to id2(C) == B, denoted as E1(C: A->B). For example,
                       this event may occur when content C processes a
                       "setPropertyValues" command changing its "Title" propery,
                       or when afolder that hierarchicaly contains C changes
                       its identity.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>E2</td><td>The state of a content C changes from Alive to Deleted,
                       denoted as E2(C). For example, this event may occur when
                       content C processes a "delete"	command, or when a content
                       representing an IMAP message gets informed	by the IMAP
                       server that the message has been deleted.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>E3</td><td>The set of children of a folder content F is enlarged by
                       some identifier A (that was not previously in that set,
                       i.e., !(A in H1(F)) && (A in H2(F))), denoted as E3(F, A).
                       For example, this event may occur when a new content
                       created at folder F processes its "insert" command, or
                       when a folder representing	an IMAP mailbox gets informed
                       by the IMAP server that a new message has arrived at that
                       mailbox.</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    Finally, the list of reactions taken by contents in response to the above
    events gives a description of what kinds of ContentEvents are sent in which
    situations:
    </p>

    <table border =1>
    <tr><td>R1</td><td>E1(C: A->B) results in C sending an EXCHANGED
                       ContentEvent, which then results in the following: All
                       folders F that used to have A as a child, but will not
                       have B as a child, i.e., (A in H1(F)) && !(B in H2(F)),
                       send a REMOVED ContentEvent.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>R2</td><td>E2(C) results in C sending a DELETED ContentEvent,
                       which then results in the following:  All folders F that
                       used to have A as a child, but will not continue to have
                       A as a child, i.e., (A in H1(F)) && !(A in H2(F)), send
                       a REMOVED event.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>R3</td><td>E3(F, A) results in F sending an INSERTED event.</td></tr>
    </table>
