        <ol>
        <li>
        A PCP Stream (<type>PackageStreamContent</type>) is a content which
        represents a file inside a package.	It is always contained in a PCP
        Folder. A PCP Stream has no children.
        </li>
        <li>
        A PCP Folder (<type>PackageFolderContent</type>) is a container for
        other PCP Folders and PCP Streams.
        </li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>URL Scheme for PCP Contents</b>

        <p>Each HCP content has an identifier corresponding to the following
