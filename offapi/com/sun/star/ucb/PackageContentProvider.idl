        <b>PCP Contents</b>
        <ol>
        <li>
        A PCP Stream (<type>PackageStreamContent</type>) is a content which
        represents a file inside a package.	It is always contained in a PCP
        Folder. A PCP Stream has no children.
        </li>
        <li>
        A PCP Folder (<type>PackageFolderContent</type>) is a container for
        other PCP Folders and PCP Streams.
        </li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>URL Scheme for PCP Contents</b>

        <p>Each HCP content has an identifier corresponding to the following
        scheme:

        <ul>
        <li>
        package-URL    = "vnd.sun.star.pkg://" orig-URL [ abs-path ]

        <li>
        path-segements = segment *( "/" segment )
        </li>
        <li>
        segment        = pchar
        </li>
        <li>
        pchar          = unreserved | escaped | ":" | "@" | "&" | "="
                         | "+" | "$" | ","
        </li>
        <li>
        unreserved     = alphanum | mark
        </li>
        <li>
        mark           = "-" | "_" | "." | "!" | "~" | "*" | "'" | "(" | ")"
        </li>
        <li>
        escaped        = "%" hex hex
        </li>
        <li>
        orig-URL       = 1 *( unreserved | escaped | "$" | "," | ";"
                         | ":" | "@" | "&" | "&" | "=" | "+"

        <li>
