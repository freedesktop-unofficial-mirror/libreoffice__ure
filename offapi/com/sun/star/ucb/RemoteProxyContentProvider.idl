    (potentially) have been distributed to a UCB.

    <p>Before trying to pass a request to a 'real,' underlying content provider
    (which will most likely be a remote content provider distributed to this
    UCB), this proxy first activates any remote content providers that have
    been distributed here, but are still inactive (see
    <type>RemoteContentProviderAcceptor</type> and
    <type>XRemoteContentProviderActivator</type> for more information).

    <p>The way this works might change, therefore this interface is marked as
    deprectated.
