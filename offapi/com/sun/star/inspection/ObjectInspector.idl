/** describes an <type scope="com::sun::star::frame">Controller</type> which can be used to
    browse and modify properties of components.

    <p>The controller can be plugged into an <type scope="com::sun::star::frame">XFrame</type>, and will
    provide a visual component for inspecting and modifying component properties.<br/>
    Note that "property" here is a generic term - any aspect of a component can be considered a property,
    as long as some property handler is able to describe this aspect in a property-like way.</p>

    <p>The basic idea is that one facet of the inspected component is represented by a single line
    of controls: A label, an input control, and optionally one or two buttons which, when pressed,
    trigger additional user interaction (e.g. a more sophisticated dialog to enter a property value).</p>

    <p>Additionally, property lines can be grouped into different categories. A usual implementation
    of such categories would be tab pages, but other implementations are possible, too.</p>

    <p>Even more, the inspector can optionally display a help section at the bottom of its
    window, which can display arbitrary (context-sensitive) help texts.</p>

    <p>An <type>ObjectInspector</type> needs one or more property handlers which describe
    the facets of an inspected component - without such handlers, the inspector window will simply
    stay empty.</p>

    <p>The property handlers, as well as more information about the layout of the inspector,
    are provided by a inspector model, which has to be implemented by the user of the inspector.</p>
    <p/>

    <p>Since property handlers might have the need to raise UI, they will be created with a context
    value named "DialogParentWindow", which contains an XWindow which should be used as parent of
    any windows to raise.<br/>
    If the <type scope="com::sun::star::uno">XComponentContext</type> in which the <type>ObjectInspector</type>
    was created already contains such a value, it is not overwritten. Only if it doesn't, the inspector
    will add an own value - which contains the inspector's main window - to the context when creating
    handlers.</p>
