        <p>
        The method iterates through it's internal variables list to match the
        variables in the given string. A match replaces the variable with the
        string defined for this variable. If no variable can be found in the string
        it will be returned unchanged. The behavior if a variable is found in
        the string but it is unknown for the implementation depends on the parameter 
        bSubstRequired.
        </p>

        @param aText
            A string containing variables that should be substituted.

        @param bSubstRequired
            Specifies if a successfull substitution is required. The 
            function throws a <type scope="com::sun::star::container">NoSuchElementException</type>
            if it finds a variable that is unknown. In this case it is possible 
            that the returned string would not be what the caller expected!
