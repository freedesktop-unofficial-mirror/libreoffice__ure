    curve.<p>

    The data is stored real-valued. The last point of the segment is
    taken from the first point of the following segment, and thus not
    included herein. That is, when forming a polygon out of cubic
    Bezier segments, each two consecutive RealBezierSegment2D
    define the actual curve, with the very last segment providing only
    the end point of the last curve, and the remaining members
    ignored.<p>
