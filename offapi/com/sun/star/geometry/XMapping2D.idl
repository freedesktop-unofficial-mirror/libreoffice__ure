/** Interface defining an arbitrary bijective mapping from R^2 to R^2.<p>

    This interface provides methods to define an arbitrary bijective
    mapping from R^2 to R^2, i.e. from the two-dimensional space of
    real numbers onto itself, as is representable by the
    <type>double</type> floating point type. The mapping must be
    bijective, i.e. map a pair of real numbers to exactly one other
    pair of real numbers an vice versa, to facilitate a working
    inverse. Bijectiveness also implies completeness, i.e. for every
    pair of real numbers there must be another pair that is mapped
    upon them.<p>
