    The data is stored integer-valued. The last point of the segment
    is taken from the first point of the following segment, and thus
    not included herein. That is, when forming a polygon out of cubic
    Bezier segments, each two consecutive IntegerBezierSegment2Ds
    define the actual curve, with the very last segment providing only
    the end point of the last curve, and the remaining members
    ignored.<p>
