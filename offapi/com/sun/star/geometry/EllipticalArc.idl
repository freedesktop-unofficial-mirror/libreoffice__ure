/** This structure specifies an arbitrary elliptical arc.<p>

    This structure contains all parameters necessary to specify
    arbitrary elliptical arcs. The parameters are modelled closely
    after the <a href="www.w3c.org">SVG</a> specification.<p>

    As with the parameters below, there are mostly four different
    ellipses arcs (two different ellipses, on which four different
    arcs connect start and end point) which satisfy the given set of
    constrains. Thus, there are two flags indicating which one of those
    ellipses should be taken.<p>
