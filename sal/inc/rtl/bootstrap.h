/**
   The described concept provides a platform independent way to access 
   minimum bootstrap settings for every application by excplitly or 
   implicitly passing the values to the application.

   4-LEVEL STRATEGY FOR RETRIEVAL OF BOOTSTRAP VALUES :

   The 1st level is tried first. On failure, 
   the next level is tried. Every query starts at the first level again, so 
   that one setting may be taken from the 3rd and one from the 1st level.

   1st level: command line arguments. A "-env:SETTINGNAME=value" is given on 
   command line. This allows to give an application a certain setting, even 
   if an ini-file exists (espicially useful for e.g. daemons that want to 
   start an executable with dynamical changing settings).

   2nd level: ini-files. Every application looks for an ini-file.  
   The filename defaults to /absoulte/path/to/executable[rc|.ini]
   (without .bin or .exe suffix). The ini-filename can be
   set by the special command line parameter
   '-env:INIFILENAME=/absolute/path/to/inifile' at runtime or it may
   be set at compiletime by an API-call.

   3rd level: environment variables. The application tries to get the 
   setting from the environment.

   4th level: default. An application can have some default settings decided 
   at compile time, which allow the application to run even with no 
   deployment settings. 

   If neither of the 4 levels leads to an successful retrieval of the value 
   (no default possible), the application may  fail to start.

   NAMING CONVENTIONS 

   Naming conventions for names of bootstrap values :
   Names may only include characters, that are allowed charcters for 
   environment variables. This excludes '.', ' ', ';', ':' and any non-ascii 
   character. Names are case insensitive.
   
   The ini-file is only allowed to have one section, which must be named '[Bootstrap]'.
   The section may be omitted.
   The section name does not appear in the name of the corresponding
   environment variable or commandline arg.
   Values maybe arbitrary unicode strings, they must be encoded in UTF8.

   Example:
   
   in an ini-file:
   [Sectionname]
   Name=value

   as commandline arg:
   -env:Name=value

   as environment
   setenv Name value
   set Name=value

   SPECIAL VARIABLES:

   - INIFILENAME
     This variable allows to set the inifilename. This makes only sense, if the filename
     is different than the executable file name. It must be given on command line. If it is
     given the executable ini-file is ignored.
*/
    
/** may be called by an application to set an ini-filename.
    
    Must be called before rtl_bootstrap_get(). May not be called twice.
    If it is never called, a the filename executable.ini (win)
    or execuablerc (unx) is assumed.

    @pName Name of the inifile with path but WITHOUT 
           suffix (.ini or rc)

void SAL_CALL rtl_bootstrap_setIniFileName( rtl_uString *pName );

/** 
   @param ppValue
        out parameter. Contains always a valid rtl_uString pointer.
   @param pName 
            The name of the bootstrap setting to be
        retrieved.
   @param pDefault  
        maybe NULL. If once the default is 
           returned, successive calls always return this
           default value, even when called with different
           defaults.

   @return sal_True, when a value could be retrieved successfully
           sal_False, when none of the 4 methods gave a value. ppValue
           then contains ane empty string.
           When a pDefault value is given, the function returns always
           sal_True.
