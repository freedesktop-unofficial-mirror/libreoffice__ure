     A 'char class' defines which (ASCII) characters can be written 'as they
     are' in a part of a Uri, and which characters have to be written using
     escape sequences ('%' followed by two hex digits).  Characters outside
     the ASCII range are always written using escape sequences.

     @descr
     If there are other frequently used char classes, they can be added to
     this enumeration; the function rtl_getUriCharClass() has to be adapted
     then, too.
