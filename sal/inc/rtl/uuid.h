/***
 * (from <draft-leach-uuids-guids-01.txt> )
 * Specification
 *
 * A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both space and time,
 * with respect to the space of all UUIDs. To be precise, the UUID
 * consists of a finite bit space. Thus the time value used for
 * constructing a UUID is limited and will roll over in the future
 * (approximately at A.D. 3400, based on the specified algorithm). A
 * UUID can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an
 * extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent
 * objects across a network.
 *
 * The generation of UUIDs does not require that a registration
 * authority be contacted for each identifier. Instead, it requires a
 * unique value over space for each UUID generator. This spatially
 * unique value is specified as an IEEE 802 address, which is usually
 * already available to network-connected systems. This 48-bit address
 * can be assigned based on an address block obtained through the IEEE
 * registration authority.

 * Generates a new UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier).
 * If available, the ethernetaddress of a networkcard is used, otherwise
 * a 6 Byte random number is generated( for which rtlRandomPool is used ).
 * 
 * 
 * @param pTargetUUID          pointer to at least 16 bytes of memory. After the call it contains
 *                             the newly generated uuid in network byte order.
 * @param pPredecessorUUID     pointer to the previously generated uuid in network byte
 *                             order. The generator reuses the 6-Byte random value
 *                             and the two byte context value and ensures,
 *                             that pTargetUUID is generated with a later timestamp.
 *                             Set pPredecessorUUID to 0 if no predecessor is available.
 *                             The caller is responsible for making the value persistent
 *                             (if desired).
 * @param bUseEthernetAddress  if sal_True, the generator uses the ethernet address of a
 *                             network card (if available). <br>
 *                             if sal_False, the generator generates a new 6-Byte random
 *                             value each time it is called with pPredecessorUUID = 0.

/****
 * The version 3 UUID is meant for generating UUIDs from "names" that
 * are drawn from, and unique within, some "name space". Some examples
 * of names (and, implicitly, name spaces) might be DNS names, URLs, ISO
 * Object IDs (OIDs), reserved words in a programming language, or X.500
 * Distinguished Names (DNs); thus, the concept of name and name space
 * should be broadly construed, and not limited to textual names. 
 *
 * The requirements for such UUIDs are as follows:
 *
 * - The UUIDs generated at different times from the same name in the
 *   same namespace MUST be equal
 *
 * - The UUIDs generated from two different names in the same namespace
 *   should be different (with very high probability)
 *
 * - The UUIDs generated from the same name in two different namespaces
 *   should be different with (very high probability)
 *
 * - If two UUIDs that were generated from names are equal, then they
 *   were generated from the same name in the same namespace (with very
 *   high probability).
 *
 * @param pTargetUUID pointer to at least 16 bytes of memory. After the call
 *                    it contains the newly generated uuid in network byte order.
 * @param pNameSpaceUUID The namespace uuid. Below are some predefined ones,
 *                       but any arbitray uuid can be used as namespace.
 * 
 * @param pName the name
