/**	@descr
    Is able to parse an XML file with Component descriptions. Gives access
    to the parsed data.

    Use:
        CompDescrsFromAnXmlFile aCds;
        UniString aFilepath(...);
        if (! aCds.Parse(aFilepath) )
        {
            // react on:
            aCds.Status();
        }

        With operator[] you get access to ComponentDescriptions
        on indices 0 to NrOfDescriptions()-1 .

        For further handling see class ComponentDescription
        in xml_cd.hxx .

        It is possible to parse more than one time. Then the old data
        are discarded.
