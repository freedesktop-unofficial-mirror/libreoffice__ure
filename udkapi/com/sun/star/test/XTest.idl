        afterwards (e.g., a closed XOutputStream). The method in general may 
        be called multiple times with a new test object instance. Note: Each test 
        scenario should be independent of each other, so even if a scenario 
        didn't pass the test, the other test can still be performed.

        Test the object TestObject against the test specified with TestName	using 
        several threads. That does NOT mean that testMultiThread should	implement 
        a test using several threads but that this test method should be designed 
        to be called by several threads. So for example, it has to take into consideration 
        that a test object state that is changed by the method	can be 
        changed again by another thread. So it's not necessarily a mistake if an
        expected state can't be confirmed after setting it. Besides that, everything 
        is the same as described for the test method.

        If this way of testing with multiple threads is not appropriate for the
        component to be tested this method should not be implemented (it should 
        only return -1) and a special multithread test adapted to the special 
        needs of testing this component should be integrated in the test method.

        @param TestName
