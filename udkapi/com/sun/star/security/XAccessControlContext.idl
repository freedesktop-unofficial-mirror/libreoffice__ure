/** An XAccessControlContext is used to make system resource access decisions

    <p>
    More specifically, it encapsulates a context and has methods to check
    permissions equivalent to XAccessController interface,
    with one difference:
    The XAccessControlContext makes access decisions
    based on the context it encapsulates, rather than
    that of the current execution thread.

        permission should be allowed or denied, based on this context.
        The semantics are equivalent to the security permission classes of
        the Java platform.
        <p>
        You can also pass a sequence of permissions (sequence< any >) to check
        a set of permissions, e.g. for performance reasons.
