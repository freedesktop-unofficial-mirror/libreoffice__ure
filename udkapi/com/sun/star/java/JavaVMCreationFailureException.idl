/** indicates that the Java Virtual Machine could not be created <p>
    This exception can be thrown when the creation of the Java Virtual
    Machine failed, even if the runtime library could be loaded.
    Possible reasons for a failure are that JNI_CreateJavaVM returns
    an error code that reflects a failure, JNI_CreateJavaVM does not
    return because it tries to quit the process ( _exit), the shared 
    library is corrupted, so that the symbols for JNI_GetDefaultVMInitArgs
    or JNI_CreateJavaVM cannot be found, etc.
