/** Provides functionality to create an adapter that supports (a) 
    special interface type(s) and maps calls to the	interface's
    methods to an invocation interface.

    <p>	
    An adapter like this allows generic dispatch interfaces to
    meet interface requirements, e.g. if a specific listener
    interface has to be passed to an add...Listener method.
    </p>
        
    <p>	
    The adapter has to support 
        <type scope="com::sun::star::script">XInvocationAdapterFactory</type>.
    The adapter may also support 
        <type scope="com::sun::star::script">XInvocationAdapterFactory2</type>.
