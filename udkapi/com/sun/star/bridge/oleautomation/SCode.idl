/** <p>is the UNO representation of the Automation type SCODE.
    </p>
    <p>
    A <code>SCODE</code> is used to express errors in Automation.
    In UNO it could be represented by a <atom>long</atom> and therefore a typedef
    from <atom>long</atom> to a particular error type  would do. But a typedef
    cannot be expressed in all language bindings. In the case where no typedefs
    are supported the actual type is used. That is, a typedef'd error type would
    be represented as <code>int</code> in Java. The information that the
    <code>int</code> is an error type is lost.
    </p>
    <p>
    When calling Automation objects from UNO the distinction between error type
    and <atom>long</atom> is important. Therefore the <type>Scode</type> is
    declared as struct.
    </p>
