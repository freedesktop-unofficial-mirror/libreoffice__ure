/** represents a named argument in a call to a method of an Automation object.
    <p>
    The Automation bridge accepts values of <type>NamedArgument</type> when a
    call to an Automation object is made. The call is done through the
    <method scope="com::sun::star::script">XInvocation::invoke</method>
    method, which takes all arguments in a sequence of anys. Usually the order
    of the arguments must correspond to the order of arguments in the Automation
    method. By using instances of <type>NamedArgument</type> the arguments in the
    sequence can be unordered. The Automation object being called must support
    named arguments, otherwise the call fails.
