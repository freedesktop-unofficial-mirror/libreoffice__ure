/** registers UNO objects as COM objects.
    <p>
    That is, COM class factories are registered with COM at runtime. The required
    EXE server is the application which deploys this service. In order to access
    the	factories by COM API functions, there need to be proper registry entries.
    This service does not provide for writing those entries.
    </p>
    <p>
    The instantiation of the registered objects can be carried out by any
    ordinary mechanism which is used in a certain language to create COM
    components. For example, <code>CreateObject</code> in Visual Basic,
    <code>CoCreateInstance</code> in C++.
    </p>
    <p>
    Currently only a factory for the service
    <type scope="com::sun::star::lang">MultiServiceFactory</type> is registered
    by this service. The CLSID is {82154420-0FBF-11d4-8313-005004526AB4} and the
    ProgId is com.sun.star.ServiceManager.
    </p>
    <p>
    <type>ApplicationRegistration</type> does not provide any particular
    interface because the UNO objects are registered while instantiating this
    service and deregistered if the implementation, which makes use of this
    service, is being released.
    </p>
