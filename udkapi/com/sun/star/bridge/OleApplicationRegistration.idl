/** registers UNO objects as COM objects.
    <p />
    That is, COM class factories are registered with COM at runtime. The required
    EXE server is the application which deploys this service. In order to access the
    factories by COM API functions, there need to be proper registry entries. This service
    does not provide for writing those entries.<p>
    The instantiation of the registered objects can be carried out by any ordinary mechanism
    which is used in a certain language to create COM components. For example, CreateObject
    in Visual Basic, CoCreateInstance in C++.
    <p />
    Currently only a factory for the service com.sun.star.long.MultiServiceFactory is registered
    by this service. The CLSID is {82154420-0FBF-11d4-8313-005004526AB4} and the ProgId is
    com.sun.star.ServiceManager.
    
    <p>OleApplicationRegistration does not provide any particular interface because the UNO objects 
    are registered while instantiating this service and deregistered 
    if the implementation, which makes use of this service, is being released.</p>
