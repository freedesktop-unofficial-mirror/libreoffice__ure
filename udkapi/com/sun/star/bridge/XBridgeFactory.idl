    /** tries to create a UNO interprocess bridge.

        @param sName 
            The name of the bridge. This allows other components to reuse 
             an already created bridge (using getBridge).
             <p>
             If empty, an anonymous bridge is created, which cannot be retrieved with
             getBridge(). No BridgeExistsException can be thrown in this case.

        @param sProtocol   
            The protocol, that will be used on the connection (e.g., urp) plus additional
            comma separated name=value protocol properties.

        @param aConnection 
            The connection, which is used to transfer the calls. The bridge expects to
            own the connection, thus it will close the connection, in case it does not
            need it anymore.

        @param anInstanceProvider 
            gets called, when a request from remote comes in. You can pass a null reference
            in case you don't want to export any objects.
        
        @throws BridgeExistsException 
            There is already a bridge registered with this name.  Use getBridge instead. 

        @throws IllegalArgumentException 
            The protocol is unknown or the connection is null.
