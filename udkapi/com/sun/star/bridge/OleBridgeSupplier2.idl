/** maps UNO types to oleautomation types and vice versa.<p>

    The XBridgeSupplier2 interface provides the function <code>createBridge</code> which
    maps a value of an UNO or Automation type to the desired target type. If an UNO interface
    was mapped  to IDispatch, then all objects (interfaces, structs) and other
    types which
    are obtained from that Automation object are automatically mapped to the corresponding
     Automation types. Hence, if one provides an initial object which forms the root of all
     other objects, such as a service manager, then only that object needs to be explicitly
     mapped by a call to <code>createBridge</code>. The same holds true if an automation 
     object is mapped to an UNO interface.<br>
    <p>The Automation types <code>VT_CY</code> and <code>VT_DATE</code> are not supported.
    For Automation objects to be mapped they have to implement IDispatch interface. Other
    COM interfaces,
    except for IUnknown, are not supported.UNO interfaces and structs are mapped to IDispatch.
    
    <p>The service implements the <type>XBridgeSupplier2</type> interface 
    and handles the model types 
    <const>com::sun::star::bridge::ModelDependent::UNO</const> and 
    <const>com::sun::star::bridge::ModelDependent::OLE</const>.  
    The service does not specify any
    requirements for registering OLE objects and class factories. </p>
