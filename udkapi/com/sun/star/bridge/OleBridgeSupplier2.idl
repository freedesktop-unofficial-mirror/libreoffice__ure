/** maps UNO types to COM types and vice versa. <p>

    The COM types are restricted to those types that can be represented
    by a <code>VARIANT</code> except for <code>VT_CY</code> and 
    <code>VT_DATE</code>. An <code>IUnknown</code> interface
    can only be mapped, if it can be successfully queried for 
    <code>IDispatch</code>. 
    Other COM interfaces are not supported. On the other hand UNO objects
    and structs are always mapped to COM objects exposing <code>IDispatch</code>.
    
    
    <p>The service implements the <type>XBridgeSupplier2</type> interface 
    and handles the model types 
    <const>com::sun::star::bridge::ModelDependent::UNO</const> and 
    <const>com::sun::star::bridge::ModelDependent::OLE</const>.  
    The service does not specify any
    requirements for registering OLE objects and class factories.
