/** makes it possible to store the data and structure of runtime objects.
    
    
    
    <p>In every case all participating objects have to be stored or
    loaded at the same time. To be able to load objects, for each object
    class in the stream, a factory is needed. These factories are
    <type scope="com::sun::star::lang">XMultiServiceFactory</type>, which are
    registered at the global service manager.
    
    </p>
    
    
    
    
    
    @example <p>Given: Object A refers to B, B to C and C to A and D. The order
    of storing and loading these objects is irrelevant, but it must be
    the same for each action:
    
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>storing: A,B,C,D; loading: A,B,C,D is correct
    </li>
    <li>storing: B,A,C,D; loading: B,A,C,D is correct
    </li>
    <li>storing: C,A,B,D; loading: A,B,C,D is wrong
    </li>
    <li>storing: A,B,C,D; loading: A,B,C is wrong</li>
    </ul>
