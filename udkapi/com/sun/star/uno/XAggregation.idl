/** Objects which implement this interface can become aggregates of
    a delegator.
    
    <p>That means if an object "A" aggregates "B", "A" can provide all
    or some of the interfaces of "B". Whenever the method
    <member>XInterface::queryInterface()</member>
    is called on either of the objects, the call will be forwarded
    to object "A". Object "A" now can determine whether to use the
    interfaces of "A" or "B" or neither. Actually, any number of 
    aggregates can be used, even nested ones (aggregated objects which are
    delegators by themselves).
    
    <p>The following rules are to be observed:
    <ol>
    <li>All calls to <member>XInterface::acquire()</member>
    which are made before the delegator was set (using the method
    <member>XAggregation::setDelegator()</member>) must not be taken back 
    (using the method <member>XInterface::release()</member>)
    before the delegation is removed by calling
    <code>xAggregation-&gt;setDelegator(NULL)</code>.
    
    <li>The constructor of a delegator has to increment its 
    own reference count by calling its method 
    <member>XInterface::acquire()</member>
    before it sets itself to any aggregate using the method
    <member>XAggregation::setDelegator()</member>. After that
    call it has to reset its own reference count without the 
    destructor getting called.
    
    <li>The destructor of a delegator has to reset the delegator in
    its aggregated objects by calling their method
    <member>XAggregation::setDelegator()</member> with 
    <const>NULL</const> before it releases its reference to 
    its aggregated objects.
    </ol>

    @deprecated
    Aggregation will no longer be supported as a high-level concept of UNO.
    You may still have the option to implement an UNO object consisting of
    several single objects in your specific programming language, though this
    depends on your programming language.

        removed and thus the object becomes its own delegator and has

        is to be called by the delegator if it does not implement the
        interface itself. An object which got aggregated cannot depend
        on getting its own interface when it calls the method
        <member>XInterface::queryInterface()</member>.
