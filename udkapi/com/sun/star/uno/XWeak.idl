/** the server-side interface to a weak object.
    
    
    
    <p>This interface is proxy to the adapted object. 
    In order to make it possible to have weak references to objects, 
    the <type>XAdapter</type> interface must be implemented to provide
    a weak adapter for the clients.
    
    <h4>Concept of weak referencing:</h4>
    
    </p>
    <p>This module specifies the interfaces for implementing and using
    weak references.</p>
    <p>
    
    </p>
    <p>The sense of weak references is to hold a reference to an object 
    without affecting the lifetime of the object. That means that a weak 
    reference may become invalid at any time if the referenced object dies.
    
    </p>
    <p>The following interfaces describe one way to handle weak references 
    by providing a weak adapter. The weak object has to provide this 
    adapter if anyone wants to hold a weak reference. To separate their
    lifetimes, the adapter and the original object must not share the same
    reference counter.  The weak reference is in fact only a hard reference
    to the adapter, which knows - but does not hold - the original object.
    That means that the implementation and synchronization of weak 
    referencing is the responsibility of the object.  The following 
    interfaces are involved in the concept of weak referencing:
    
    <dl>
    <dt>
    <type>XWeak</type> 
    </dt>
    <dd>is the server-side interface of the referred object. This
    referred object must support the <type>XAdapter</type> interface.
    
    </dd>
    <dt>
    <type>XReference</type> 
    </dt>
    <dd>is a client-side interface which must be implemented by
    the holder of any weak reference. It is used for notification
    when the adapted object dies.
    
    </dd>
    </dl>
    </p>

        the adapted object. If the adapted object dies, all references 
        to the adapter have to be notified to release the adapter.
