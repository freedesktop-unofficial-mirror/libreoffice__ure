        may be used in a stack-like fashion (care is taken to only really

    /** Create a wrapper around a Java virtual machine.

        @param pVm
        A JNI pointer to virtual machine.  Must not be null.

        @param nVersion
        The JNI version of the virtual machine pointed to by pVm.  Must be at
        least JNI_VERSION_1_2.  This parameter should be of type jint, not int,
        but at least on some platforms the definition of jint changed from
        JDK 1.3 (long) to JDK 1.4 (int), so that the mangled C++ name of the
        constructor would depend on the JDK version used at compile time.

        @param bDestroy
        Whether to destroy the virtual machine when destructing the wrapper
        (i.e., whether the wrapper owns the virtual machine pointed to by pVm).

        @param pMainThreadEnv
        A valid JNI environment pointer for the current thread; must not be
        null.  The current thread must be "initially attached" to the virtual
        machine while this constructor is being called (i.e., it must be the
        thread that has called JNI_CreateJavaVM in case the virtual machine has
        been started via the JNI Invocation API, and it must not already have
        called DetachCurrentThread; or it must be executing native code called
        from a "primordial" virtual machine).  This environment pointer is used
        to obtain a reference to the thread's current context class loader
        (java.lang.Thread.getCurrentClassLoader).  If later a native thread is
        attached to the virtual machine, that thread's context class loader
        would be null, so the AttachGuard first of all sets it to the saved
        value.  In a nutshell, this means that all native threads attached to
        the virtual machine use the context class loader of the "initial Java
        thread."
