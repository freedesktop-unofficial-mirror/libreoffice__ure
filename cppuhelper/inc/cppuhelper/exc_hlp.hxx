    Currently under investigation if this function runs with all known
    C++-UNO bridges.  Until now tested for:
    
    - CC5, Solaris SPARC
    - MSVC .NET 2002/2003, Windows
    - gcc 3.2.2, Linux Intel
    
    
    Use this function to get the dynamic type of a caught C++-UNO exception,
    e.g.
    
    try
    {
        ...
    }
    catch (::com::sun::star::uno::Exception &)
    {
        ::com::sun::star::uno::Any caught( ::cppu::getCaughtException() );
        ...
    }
    
    Restrictions:
    
    - only use for caught UNO exceptions
      (C++ exceptions derived from com::sun::star::uno::Exception)
    - only as first statement in a catch block!
    - never do a C++ rethrow (throw;) again after you have called this function
      and call getCaughtException() just once!
      (function internally uses a C++ rethrow)
    
    @return
              caught UNO exception

    @attention
              This function is limited to the same C++ compiler runtime library.
              E.g. for MSVC, this means that the catch handler code (the one
              that calls getCaughtException()) needs to use the very same
              msvcrt.dll as cppuhelper3MSC.dll and the bridge msci_uno.dll,
              e.g. all them are compiled with the same compiler version.
              This is because the msci_uno.dll gets a rethrown exception out
              of the internal msvcrt.dll thread local data (tls).
              Thus you must not use this function if your code needs to run
              in newer UDK versions without being recompiled, because those
              newer UDK (-> OOo versions) potentially use a newer MSVC
              (which potentially uses an incompatible msvcrt.dll).
