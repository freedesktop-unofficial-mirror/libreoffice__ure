 * The UNO IDL type any is mapped to java type <code>java.lang.Object</code>.

 * In special cases it is necessary to have an explicit any to additionally transport
 * an exact type. For instance if you want to pass an object reference via
 * an interprocess connection using an any, you should use this class to add
 * an explicit interface type, so the remote counterpart doesn't need to invoke
 * a queryInterface).
