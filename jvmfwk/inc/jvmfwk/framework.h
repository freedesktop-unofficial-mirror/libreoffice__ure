    plug-in libraries. Only these libraries are responsible for locating JRE
    installations.</p>
    <p>
    JREs can be provided by different vendors. In order to find the JREs of
    a certain vendor a plug-in library must be provided. There must be only one
    library for one vendor. The names of locations of those libraries have to
    be put into the javavendors.xml file.<br/>
    The function uses the plug-in libraries to obtain information about JRE
    installation and checks if they there is one among them that supports
    a set of features (currently only accessibilty is possible). If none was
    found then it also uses a list of paths, which have been registered
    by <code>jfw_addJRELocation</code> or <code>jfw_setJRELocations</code>
    to find JREs. Found JREs are examined in the same way.</p>
    <p>
    A JRE installation is only selected if it meets the version requirements.
    Information about the selected JRE are made persistent so that
    subsequent calls to <code>jfw_getSelectedJRE</code> returns this
    information.</p>
    <p>
    While determining a proper JRE this function takes into account if a
    user requires support for assistive technology tools. If user
    need that support they have to set up their system accordingly. When support
    for assistive technology is required, then the lists of
    <code>JavaInfo</code> objects,
    which are provided by the <code>getJavaInfo</code> functions of the plug-ins, are
    examined for a suitable JRE. That is, the <code>JavaInfo</code> objects
    from the list
    obtained from the first plug-in, are examined. If no <code>JavaInfo</code>
    object has the flag
    <code>JFW_FEATURE_ACCESSBRIDGE</code> in the member <code>nFeatures</code>
    then the
    next plug-in is used to obtain a list of <code>JavaInfo</code> objects.
    This goes on until a <code>JavaInfo</code> object was found which
    represents a suitable JRE. Or neither plug-in provided such a
    <code>JavaInfo</code> object. In that case the first
    <code>JavaInfo</code> object from the first plug-in is used to determine
    the JRE which is to be used.</p>
    <p>
    If there is no need for the support of assistive technology tools then
    the first <code>JavaInfo</code> object from the list obtained by the
    first plug-in is used. If this plug-in does not find any JREs then the
    next plug-in is used, and so on.</p>
