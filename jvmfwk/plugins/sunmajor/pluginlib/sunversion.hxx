/* SunVersion is used to compare java versions based on a string, as taken
   from the registry. The strings look like "1.3", "1.3.1", "1.3.1_02" etc.
   Versions such as "1.4.1_01a" are allowed although this is not specified.
   1.4.1_01 < 1.4.1_01a < 1.4.1_01b < 1.4.1_02
   Pre - release versions, such as 1.4.1-ea, 1.4.1-beta, 1.4.1-rc are recognized,
   but are treated as minor to release versions:
   1.4.0 > 1.4.2-beta
   Pre releases relate this way
   1.4.1-ea < 1.4.1-beta < 1.4.1-rc1

   An object acts as holder for the version string. That string may be present
   even if the version could not be parsed. Then the version may not be compatible
   to a SUN Java version.

   An invalid object, that is, operator bool returns false, will always be
   the lower version in a comparison. If two invalid objects are compared
   then they are considered equal.
   
   To test if the version is ok, that is this object can be compared to others,
   use the bool conversion operator.
